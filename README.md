# Shell-C-Implementation
Worked with two colleagues on implementating a Shell that can execute the same commands as a real terminal:\
**-history**\
**-cd**\
**-pwd**\
**-touch**\
**-echo**\
**-evaluating logical expressions**\
**-cat**\
**-compile a program**\
**-grep**\
**-quit**\
**-nano**\
**-pipe** (|)\
**-code**
